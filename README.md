I primarily worked on Django and specifically moving to class-based views as well as adding new features to my existing views such as being able to dynamically adjust for location and language preferences.
For now, I will keep the front page of my website using the current CSS and not implement Bootstrap there yet.
However, I am currently using Bootstrap on my login view which I am working on but have not commited to the public repository yet (working out some security issues).
Therefore, please grade me on the Django and existing HTML/CSS that I have. By the time of the next submission deadline, I should have all of the Bootstrap ready.

The actual website can be accessed at globalmilestone.org.
If you want, I can create an account for you so that you can view my admin page and the database setup.
All of the pages are working except for the "Become a Tutor" and "Login" page. There are some broken links on the images but that is simply because I am waiting for tutors to send me their photos.
